                <p>
                    <span class="intro-line">Typography is the art and technique of arranging type</span> to make written language
                    <mark>legible, readable, and appealing</mark> when displayed. 
                    This involves selecting <strong>font families</strong>, point sizes, 
                    line lengths, <em>line-spacing (leading)</em>, and letter-spacing (tracking).

                    Good typography is crucial for user experience. It guides the reader, 
                    establishes a visual hierarchy, and sets the overall tone of the website. 
                    In this demo, we use a <strong>serif font</strong> for the body text 
                    (like 'Georgia') for its classic readability in long-form content, 
                    and a <em>sans-serif font</em> (like 'Helvetica' or 'Arial') for headings 
                    to create a clean, modern contrast.

                <h2>Text Alignment</h2>
                <p class="align-left">
                    <strong>Left-aligned text (default):</strong> This is the most common alignment. 
                    It provides a straight "rag" on the left edge, making it easy for 
                    the eye to find the start of the next line.
                </p>
                <p class="align-center">
                    <strong>Center-aligned text:</strong> This alignment is often used 
                    for headings or short, declarative statements. It creates a formal, 
                    symmetrical look but can be difficult to read in long paragraphs.
                </p>
                <p class="align-right">
                    <strong>Right-aligned text:</strong> This is less common for body text 
                    in left-to-right languages. It can be used for stylistic effect 
                    or for positioning small bits of text, like a byline.
